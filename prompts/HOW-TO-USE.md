# How To Use This System Design Learning System

This repository is structured for deliberate architectural practice.

## Chat Architecture

Use separate chats for:

1. Roadmap (long-term planning)
2. Weekly Topic Deep Dive
3. Architecture Review
4. Interview Simulation

Do not mix them.

## Weekly Flow (2–3 hrs)

Session 1:

- Use FOUNDATIONS-DEEP-DIVE prompt.
- Take structured notes.
- Draw diagrams.

Session 2:

- Apply learning via MINI-SYSTEM-BUILD.
- Use ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.
- Write a short decision summary.

Every few weeks:

- Run END-OF-WEEK-REFLECTION.
- Refine roadmap if necessary.

## Philosophy

We prioritize:

- Mental models
- Tradeoff clarity
- Failure modeling
- Sustainable pace
- Long-term growth

Over:

- Flashy diagrams
- Tool hype
- Over-engineering
- Rushed coverage

Consistency compounds.
