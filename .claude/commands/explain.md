Give a quick, jargon-free explanation of: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for teaching approach and learner context.

## Process

This is a lightweight, conversational command — no file output.

Explain this concept clearly and concisely:

1. **One-sentence summary**: What is it, in plain language?
2. **Analogy**: Compare it to something familiar (real-world metaphor)
3. **Why it matters**: When and why would an engineer encounter this?
4. **Key detail**: One important nuance or gotcha worth knowing

Keep the explanation short (a few paragraphs max). The goal is to unblock the learner quickly so they can get back to whatever they were working on.

If this concept is complex enough to warrant a full study session, mention that they can run `/deep-dive [topic]` to go deeper.

Do NOT create a file for this command — it's purely conversational.
