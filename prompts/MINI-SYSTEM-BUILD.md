# Mini System Build Prompt

Design a small but realistic production-grade system that forces understanding of:

[TOPIC]

Constraints:

- Must include real-world scale assumptions.
- Must require explicit tradeoff decisions.
- Must include failure scenarios.
- Must avoid unnecessary complexity.

Provide:

1. Problem statement
2. Functional requirements
3. Non-functional requirements
4. Capacity assumptions
5. High-level architecture
6. Critical components
7. Scaling strategy
8. Failure modeling
9. Observability plan
10. Future evolution considerations

Optimize for learning depth, not architectural theatrics.
