## Problem Statement

<!-- What are we building and why? Who are the users? What does success look like? -->

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
<!-- What must the system do? -->

1.
2.
3.

### Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- Latency, throughput, availability, consistency, durability targets -->

1.
2.
3.

## Capacity Estimation

<!-- Back-of-envelope math. Show your work. -->

| Metric | Estimate | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Daily active users | | |
| Queries per second | | |
| Storage (Year 1) | | |
| Bandwidth | | |

## High-Level Architecture

<!-- Core components and how they interact. ASCII diagram or description. -->

```

## Detailed Component Design

### Component 1
<!-- Data model, API, key algorithms, technology choices -->

### Component 2

### Component 3

## API Design

<!-- Key endpoints or interfaces -->

## Data Model

<!-- Schema, key entities, relationships -->

## Tradeoff Decisions

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Chose | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| | | | | |

## Failure Modeling

### Single Node Failure
### Network Partition
### Data Corruption
### Cascading Failures
### Recovery Procedures

## Scaling Strategy

### Current Scale (1x)
### Growth (10x)
### Large Scale (100x)

## Observability

### Key Metrics
### Alerts
### Dashboards
### Distributed Tracing

## Security Considerations

## Evolution & Future Work

<!-- What would you revisit in 6-12 months? Known shortcuts and tech debt. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Unresolved decisions or areas needing more research -->
