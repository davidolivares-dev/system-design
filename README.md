# System Design Mastery Portfolio

This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming a Senior → Staff-level system design engineer.

The goal is not interview pattern memorization.

The goal is deep architectural understanding.

## 🎯 Objective

Over time, I am intentionally rebuilding and deepening my knowledge in:

- Distributed systems fundamentals
- Scalability patterns
- Data system design
- Failure modeling
- Tradeoff reasoning
- Observability and operability
- Long-term system evolution

This repository serves as both:

1. A public artifact of my learning
2. A long-term architectural reference library

## 🧠 Philosophy

System design is not about drawing boxes.

It is about:

- Modeling scale before it happens
- Understanding failure before it occurs
- Making tradeoffs explicit
- Simplifying complexity
- Designing for evolution, not just launch

Each project in this repository includes:

- Clear problem statements
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Capacity assumptions
- Architectural diagrams (text-based)
- Tradeoff analysis
- Failure scenarios
- Scaling strategies
- Evolution over time

The emphasis is clarity and reasoning over complexity.
