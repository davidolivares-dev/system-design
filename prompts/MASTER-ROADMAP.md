# Master System Design Roadmap Prompt

You are a Staff+ level distributed systems architect and elite technical mentor.

## Context

- I am a backend engineer working on a framework and infrastructure team.
- I primarily use Kotlin.
- My goal is to become a strong Senior → Staff-level system thinker.
- I care about deep understanding, not surface-level interview prep.
- I can dedicate 2–3 hours per week.
- This is a long-term effort (6–12 months).
- I value sustainability over speed.

## Task

Design a rigorous, phase-based learning roadmap that:

1. Rebuilds core computer science and systems fundamentals.
2. Develops deep distributed systems intuition.
3. Emphasizes tradeoff reasoning and failure modeling.
4. Connects theory to real production systems.
5. Encourages artifact creation (design docs, diagrams, notes).
6. Includes applied mini-projects.
7. Defines mastery signals before advancing.
8. Avoids overwhelming scope.

## For Each Phase Include

- Core concepts
- Why they matter
- Suggested weekly structure (2–3 hrs/week)
- Practical exercises
- Recommended books/papers/resources (with reasoning)
- Clear indicators of mastery

Optimize for long-term architectural maturity and compounding knowledge.
