Conduct a learning reflection session.

## Instructions

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for teaching approach and learner context.
2. Read `roadmap.md` to understand the current learning plan.
3. Read `reflections/_template.md` for the output format.
4. Scan recent artifacts in `notes/`, `designs/`, `reviews/`, and `adrs/` (last 2-4 weeks) to understand what the learner has been studying.

## Process

### 1. Review Recent Work
- List all artifacts created since the last reflection (or all artifacts if this is the first reflection)
- Summarize the topics covered

### 2. Understanding Assessment
For each topic studied recently, assess the learner's demonstrated understanding:
- **Emerging** — can define it, but can't apply it independently
- **Developing** — understands mechanics, starting to see tradeoffs
- **Solid** — can reason about tradeoffs and failure modes
- **Strong** — could teach it to someone else, can apply it in novel contexts

Base this on the quality and depth of their artifacts, not assumptions.

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- What themes or connections are emerging across topics?
- What mental models are strengthening?
- What recurring gaps or misconceptions appear?

### 4. Gap Analysis
- What foundational concepts are still shaky?
- What topics from the roadmap should be prioritized next?
- Are there topics the learner is avoiding that deserve attention?

### 5. Next Steps
- Suggest 2-3 specific topics or exercises for the next 2 weeks
- Recommend which slash command to use for each (e.g., `/deep-dive`, `/design`, `/tradeoff`)
- Explain *why* each suggestion matters at this point in the journey

### 6. Motivation Check
- Acknowledge progress honestly
- Note what's improving
- Keep the long-term vision in focus

## Output
Write the reflection to `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md` using today's date. Use the template from `reflections/_template.md`.

Update `roadmap.md` with any status changes (topics completed, new gaps identified).
